# Test
You can directly download our [submitted file](xxx) (including all the trained models, and all other necessary files), then by running
```
conda run --no-capture-output -n condaenv python main.py
```
you will get the query features. 

However, because the file only includes extracted reference features and normalization features, we show how to get these two features here.
