# Training

We introduce how to train the models here.

## Generate

We first use transformations to generate training images in an offline manner. Please go to the ```Generate``` folder to check more details.

## Progressive learning

We train our models in three stages. Please go to the ```Stage_1``` and ```Stage_23```, sequentially.

Finally, we get $6$ trained models for the test.
