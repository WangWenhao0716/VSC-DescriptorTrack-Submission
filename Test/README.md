# Test
You can directly download our [submitted file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--OST0kIrNsLBa7MCArztV9u46pKjcip/view?usp=share_link) (including all the trained models, and all other necessary files), then by running
```
conda run --no-capture-output -n condaenv python main.py
```
you will get the query features. 

However, because the file only includes extracted reference features and normalization features, we show how to get these two kinds of features here.
